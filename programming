We have a text file containing a list of students' names and their corresponding scores in a particular subject. 
We want to extract the names of students who scored above a certain threshold.

Here's the content of the students.txt file:
Copy code
Alice 85
Bob 73
Charlie 92
David 65
Emily 78
Frank 88
Grace 91

Let's say the passing threshold is 80. 
We want to extract the names of students who scored above 80.

We can solve this problem using awk and grep.

Solution using AWK:
awk '$2 > 80 { print $1 }' students.txt
This command will output:
Copy code
Alice
Charlie
Frank
Grace

Using grep solution just matching the regix and using cut

grep -E '^[^\s]+ [89][0-9]' students.txt | cut -d' ' -f1

and using python -

# Define the passing threshold
threshold = 80

# Read the contents of the file
with open('students.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Iterate through each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Split each line into name and score
        name, score = line.strip().split()
        
        # Convert score to an integer
        score = int(score)
        
        # Check if the score is above the threshold
        if score > threshold:
            # Print the name of the student
            print(name)
